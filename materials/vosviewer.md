This is a software tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks such as journals, researchers, or individual publications, and they can be constructed based on citation, bibliographic coupling, co-citation, or co-authorship relations. VOSviewer also offers text mining functionality that can be used to construct and visualize co-occurrence networks of important terms extracted from a body of scientific literature.

VOSviewer can be used to:

* **Visualize bibliometric networks:** VOSviewer can be used to visualize bibliometric networks in a variety of ways, such as graphs, maps, and timelines. This makes it easier to understand the relationships between different concepts.
* **Identify key players:** VOSviewer can be used to identify key players in a research field by looking at the number of papers they have published, the number of citations they have received, and the number of collaborations they have formed.
* **Identify emerging trends:** VOSviewer can be used to identify emerging trends in a research field by looking at the number of papers that have been published on a particular topic in recent years.
* **Analyze the impact of a research paper:** VOSviewer can be used to analyze the impact of a research paper by looking at the number of citations it has received and the number of times it has been used in other papers.
