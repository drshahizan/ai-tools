# AI Tools for Identifying Research Gaps

| **AI Tool** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **[MarkMap](https://github.com/drshahizan/ai-tools/blob/main/materials/markmap.md)** | Markmap is a tool that visualizes markdown documents as interactive mind maps. It's useful for organizing and navigating complex information, making it easier to understand and explore the content. |
| **[Think Machine](https://thinkmachine.com/)** | Think Machine is a powerful 3d mind mapper with AI built in. It's the best way to visualize your thoughts and research new ideas. |

| **[Research Buddy](https://researchbuddy.app/search)** | An AI-powered tool that automates the literature review process by quickly searching and categorizing scholarly content. |
| **[Research Rabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/)** | Research Rabbit is a research discovery tool that helps you find new, connected papers using a visual graph. You can essentially create maps around metadata, which helps you not only explore similar papers but also connections between them.  |
| **[Consensus.app](https://consensus.app/)** | Consensus.app works by first extracting the key information from research papers.

| **[Scite](https://scite.ai/partners/publishers)** | Analyzes the quality and credibility of research papers. While not directly identifying gaps, Scite's analysis of existing research limitations can point researchers towards areas needing more information or investigation. |
|**[LitMaps](https://www.litmaps.com/)**|This tool creates visual maps of research topics based on AI analysis of scholarly articles. These maps can reveal under-explored areas within the topic.|
| **[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)** | Offers AI-powered "augmented reader" to analyze research paper structure, highlight key information, and connect to relevant articles, revealing potential areas for further study. | 
| **[HyperWrite's](https://www.hyperwriteai.com/aitools/ai-literature-review-generator)** | HyperWrite's AI Literature Review Generator is a revolutionary tool that automates the process of creating a comprehensive literature review.
