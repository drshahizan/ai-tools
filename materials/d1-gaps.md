# AI Tools for Identifying Research Gaps

| **AI Tool** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **[MarkMap](https://github.com/drshahizan/ai-tools/blob/main/materials/markmap.md)** | Markmap is a tool that visualizes markdown documents as interactive mind maps. It's useful for organizing and navigating complex information, making it easier to understand and explore the content. |
| **[SciSpace](https://typeset.io/)** | Offers AI tools for literature review, including finding new, connected papers using a visual graph. |
| **[Research Rabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/)** | Research Rabbit is a research discovery tool that helps you find new, connected papers using a visual graph. You can essentially create maps around metadata, which helps you not only explore similar papers but also connections between them.  |
| **[Consensus.app](https://consensus.app/)** | Consensus.app works by first extracting the key information from research papers. This information includes the paper's title, abstract, keywords, and main findings. The platform then uses AI to summarize this information into a concise and easy-to-understand format. |
| **[Scite](https://scite.ai/partners/publishers)** | Analyzes the quality and credibility of research papers. While not directly identifying gaps, Scite's analysis of existing research limitations can point researchers towards areas needing more information or investigation. |
|**[LitMaps](https://www.litmaps.com/)**|This tool creates visual maps of research topics based on AI analysis of scholarly articles. These maps can reveal under-explored areas within the topic.|
| **[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)** | Offers AI-powered "augmented reader" to analyze research paper structure, highlight key information, and connect to relevant articles, revealing potential areas for further study. |
