# How to Conduct a Systematic Literature Review?

## Synthesizing the Results of the Studies

Synthesizing the results of the studies is the next step in conducting an SLR and involves summarizing the findings of the studies included in the review. This step helps to identify patterns and trends in the data and to draw meaningful conclusions about the topic of interest.

### i. Data Extraction
The pertinent information from each study must be extracted before the findings may be combined. This could entail obtaining information on certain outcomes, like the effect magnitude, or particular variables, like the study population. A systematic record of the extracted data should be kept, and the final report should provide a description of the data extraction procedure.

Summarizing the steps for data extraction in a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                                     | Example                                               |
|:------:|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Choose Data Extraction Template                 | Choose a standard template or create a custom template to extract relevant data from studies |
| 2    | Identify Data to Extract                        | Identify the data that is relevant to your SLR, such as study design, sample size, methods, results, and conclusions |
| 3    | Extract Data Consistently                        | Extract the data consistently across studies, following the chosen template |
| 4    | Record Results                                   | Record the extracted data in a consistent and systematic manner, such as in a spreadsheet or database |
| 5    | Check Data Extraction                            | Check the extracted data to ensure that it is accurate and complete |

By following these steps, you can extract relevant data from the studies included in your SLR in a consistent and systematic manner. This will help to increase the validity and reliability of the results of your review.

### ii. Data Synthesis
The data that was taken out of the studies must then be combined. This could entail performing meta-analyses, creating narrative summaries of the findings, or summarizing the data in tables or figures. The type of data and the makeup of the studies included in the review should guide the process of synthesis selection.

Steps for data synthesis in a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                                           | Example |
|:------:|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Identify Similarities and Differences                | Identify the similarities and differences in the results and conclusions of studies investigating the effectiveness of different algorithms for detecting malicious network activity. |
| 2    | Organize Results                                     | Organize the results of the studies into a summary table that includes information about the algorithms used, the dataset tested, the evaluation metric, and the results obtained. |
| 3    | Assess Consistency                                    | Assess the consistency of the results across the studies, looking for patterns and discrepancies. For example, if the majority of studies find that algorithm A is the most effective, but a few studies find that algorithm B is more effective, this may warrant further investigation. |
| 4    | Identify Gaps in the Literature                      | Identify gaps in the literature, such as studies that use different evaluation metrics or datasets. This may suggest the need for future research to validate the results across different contexts. |
| 5    | Draw Conclusions                                      | Draw conclusions based on the synthesis of the results, taking into account the quality of the studies and the overall consistency of the results. For example, the conclusion may be that algorithm A is the most effective overall, but further research is needed to validate this conclusion for different datasets and evaluation metrics. |

This example demonstrates how the steps for data synthesis can be applied in practice to synthesize the results of multiple studies in a systematic and rigorous manner, in order to draw robust conclusions based on the evidence in the literature.

### iii. Drawing Conclusions
Making judgments on the subject of interest is the last step in synthesizing the research findings. This could entail highlighting the most important conclusions, pointing out areas of agreement and disagreement, and addressing any data constraints. The findings from the studies cited in the review should be used to support the conclusions, which should be supported by the data.

| Step                | Description | Example |
|:---------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Drawing Conclusions | This step involves summarizing and synthesizing the findings from the previous steps. The conclusions drawn should be based on the data extracted and analyzed and should be supported by the available evidence. | In the example of the SLR on "Performance evaluation of cloud computing systems," the researcher may draw conclusions about the most effective cloud computing systems based on factors such as scalability, reliability, and security. |

In conclusion, a crucial component of performing an SLR is synthesizing the research findings. Researchers can make sure that their SLR offers an extensive and meaningful overview of the literature on their topic of interest by extracting pertinent data from each study, synthesizing the data, and deriving meaningful conclusions. They can contribute significantly to the field and help to improve our understanding of the subject by doing this.
