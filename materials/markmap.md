# Markmap
Markmap is a tool that visualizes markdown documents as interactive mind maps. It's useful for organizing and navigating complex information, making it easier to understand and explore the content. Here's how you can use Markmap:

1. **Prompt to create a mind map**

```
a mind map with a structured list that is centred on rice disease. Create a Markdown version of the mind map.
Start with the primary concept that embodies the primary theme found in the data. Create primary branches based on
the identified categories or important subjects. Create thorough sub-branches that focus on certain data points,
patterns, or insights for every major branch. Make sure the linkages and hierarchies within the data are adequately
visualised in the mind map.
  ```

3. **Paste the Markdown code into [MarkMap](https://markmap.js.org/repl)**: Open Markmap and paste your copied markdown content. Markmap will automatically generate an interactive mind map based on the markdown structure.

4. **Interact with Your Mind Map**: You can expand or collapse branches, zoom in and out, and pan around to explore different parts of the mind map.

Remember, Markmap supports various markdown features such as:
- **Styling**: Apply bold, italic, strikethrough, and highlights to text.
- **Code Blocks**: Include code snippets or formulas.
- **Images and Links**: Embed images and create hyperlinks.

For a detailed guide and advanced features, you can refer to the [Markmap documentation](https://mindmapexpert.com/review/how-to-create-a-mind-map-using-markmap-js/) or visit the [Markmap GitHub repository](https://github.com/dundalek/markmap). Enjoy creating and navigating your mind maps
