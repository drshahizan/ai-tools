# Paper Visualization

| No.  | Name | Description | Info | Tools |
|------: | ------------------|-----|:--------:|:--------:|
| 1. |Inciteful| The goal of Inciteful is to give the world free tools to help you map academic literature. It can be used in a variety of ways depending on what you are trying to accomplish. Start from seed paper(s), you can have an overview on the current state of that topic. Then, by adding more seed papers or filters, you can further craft the citation graph and have a focus on your search. If you are writing a paper, you can import the items in your reference list to Inciteful, and the resulting graph should be centered around the paper you are writing. |<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-discovery/inciteful" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |<a href="https://inciteful.xyz/" width="24px" height="24px" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>|
| 2. | Open Knowledge Maps | Open Knowledge Maps (OKM) is an open-source platform for creating and visualizing knowledge graphs. It is based on the RDF (Resource Description Framework) standard, which makes it possible to integrate data from different sources. |<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-visualization/open-knowledge-maps-okm" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> | <a href="https://openknowledgemaps.org/" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 3. |LitMaps|This tool creates visual maps of research topics based on AI analysis of scholarly articles. These maps can reveal under-explored areas within the topic.|<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-discovery/litmaps" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>|<a href="https://www.litmaps.com/" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 4. | Connected Papers | Free tool that allows you to visually explore the relationships between different research papers. Creates a network graph where each node represents a paper and the edges between nodes represent citations. Helpful way to find new papers that are related to the research you are already familiar with. |<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-discovery/connected-papers" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 5. | VOSviewer | VOSviewer is a software tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks, such as co-authorship networks, citation networks, and co-occurrence networks. |<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-visualization/vosviewer" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> | <a href="https://www.vosviewer.com/" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 6. | CiteSpace | CiteSpace is a software that helps you create and explore networks of publications based on citation data. You can download different versions of CiteSpace for free or with a license, and view the top 1% highly cited papers in various fields of research |<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-visualization/citespace" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> | <a href="https://citespace.podia.com/" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 7. | Gephi | Gephi is an open-source software platform for visualizing and analyzing networks. It is a powerful tool that can be used to visualize the relationships between different entities, such as people, organizations, and products. |<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-visualization/gephi" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> | <a href="https://gephi.org/" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 8. | Bibliometrix | Bibliometrix is an R-tool for comprehensive science mapping analysis. Bibliometrix is a software that helps you create and explore networks of publications based on citation data.|<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-visualization/bibliometrix" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> | <a href="https://www.bibliometrix.org/home/" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
