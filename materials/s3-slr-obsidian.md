Systematic literature review (SLR) is a method of reviewing and synthesizing existing literature on a specific topic or research question in a rigorous and transparent way¬π. Obsidian is a private and flexible writing app that allows you to store and organize your notes on your device, with hundreds of plugins and themes to customize your workflow¬≤.

You can use Obsidian to conduct a SLR by following these steps:

- Create a folder in your Obsidian vault for your SLR project.
- Define your research question and inclusion/exclusion criteria for selecting relevant literature.
- Use the [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin to create a table of literature sources, with columns for title, author, year, abstract, keywords, and other relevant information.
- Use the [Zotero](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration) plugin to import citations and PDFs from Zotero, a free and open-source reference manager.
- Use the [PDF Reader](https://github.com/elias-sundqvist/obsidian-annotator) plugin to annotate and highlight PDFs within Obsidian.
- Use the [Natural Language Dates] plugin to create daily notes for tracking your progress and reflections.
- Use the [Review] plugin to schedule periodic reviews of your notes and literature sources.
- Use the [Graph View] to visualize the connections and relationships between your notes and literature sources.
- Use the [Markdown Exporter] plugin to export your notes and literature sources as a markdown file, which you can then format and style using your preferred tool.

These are some of the plugins that can help you with your SLR project, but you can also explore other plugins and themes that suit your needs and preferences. You can find more information and tutorials on how to use Obsidian and its plugins on their [website](https://obsidian.md/) and [forum].
