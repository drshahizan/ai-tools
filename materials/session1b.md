## Session 1b

### [3. Paper Visualization](./s1-visualization.md)
**Paper visualization tools**, leveraging advanced **artificial intelligence** techniques, play a crucial role in aiding researchers to navigate and comprehend the intricate landscape of scholarly **literature**. Examples such as [**Open Knowledge Maps**](https://openknowledgemaps.org/) utilize semantic analysis and **machine learning** algorithms to extract key concepts, generating interactive visual knowledge maps that offer an intuitive overview of a research topic. [**VOSviewer**](https://www.vosviewer.com/) employs clustering algorithms and term extraction methods to create network visualizations, facilitating the exploration of relationships between **papers**, **authors**, and **keywords**. [**CiteSpace**](http://cluster.cis.drexel.edu/~cchen/citespace/) focuses on the temporal evolution of research topics, utilizing algorithms to detect emerging trends and visualize the chronological development of fields. [**Gephi**](https://gephi.org/) , a versatile network analysis tool, provides visually appealing graphs for exploring connections in bibliometric data. [**Bibliometrix**](https://bibliometrix.org/), an R-based package, combines statistical methods with visualization capabilities to generate insightful visualizations, including co-authorship networks and keyword co-occurrence maps. These AI-powered tools collectively empower researchers to identify trends, gaps, and relevant papers efficiently, enhancing their ability to navigate and contribute to the scholarly conversation.

### [4. Copywriting with ChatGPT](./s1-copywriting.md)
Exploring **copywriting** with **ChatGPT** from an **academic perspective** means looking at how **artificial intelligence (AI)** and writing work together. **ChatGPT**, an advanced language tool, changes how we create **writing**. By using smart computer programs and lots of information, this **AI** can create detailed and fitting **writing** based on what users ask. Looking at this from an **academic view** helps us understand how **ChatGPT** handles language intricacies and adjusts to different **writing styles**. It gives us a better picture of how technology and language connect. This **academic study** not only shows the potential of **AI-driven writing** in changing how we create **content** but also makes us think about important things like ethics, language details, and how human creativity fits into a world with smart machines.

### [5. Chatbot and Assistance](./s1-chatbot.md)
Chatbots and assistance tools are becoming increasingly popular as a way to provide customer service, answer questions, and even generate creative content. AI tools like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Perplexity, ChatPDF, PaperPal, and Paper Brain are being used to create chatbots and assistance tools that can understand natural language, answer questions intelligently, and even generate creative text formats.
These tools can be used for postgraduate research students by providing 24/7 access to a vast amount of information. They can also be used to help researchers to identify relevant papers, to summarize the content of papers, and to generate ideas for new research.
For example, a PhD student who is researching the effects of climate change on coral reefs could use a chatbot to ask questions about the latest research on the topic. The chatbot could then provide the student with summaries of relevant papers, as well as links to additional resources. The student could also use the chatbot to generate ideas for new research projects.
Chatbots and assistance tools can help researchers to save time by automating tasks, such as searching for papers and summarizing their content. They can also help researchers to improve the accuracy of their research by providing access to the latest research and by helping them to identify relevant papers. Additionally, chatbots and assistance tools can be personalized to the individual researcher, which can improve the research experience.

### [6. Citation Management](./s1-citation.md)
Citation management tools are indispensable assets for researchers and students, providing a systematic approach to the daunting task of handling references. These software applications, exemplified by notable tools like [EndNote](https://endnote.com/), [RefWorks](https://www.refworks.com/), [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), and [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), offer a comprehensive solution to the complexities of organizing, tracking, and citing sources. 

### [7. Managing a Systematic Review](./s1-systematic-review.md)
Managing a systematic review is a complex process that requires careful planning and execution. There are a number of tools available to help researchers manage their systematic reviews, including: Rayyan. SysRev, Convidence, RevMan, Readwise, Obsidian, colandr, SRDR+ (AHRQ), The Systematic Review Toolbox, PRISMA-P, EQUATOR Network and DistillerSR.

### [8. Text Summarizers](./s1-summarizers.md)
Text summarizers like Elicit, SciSpace, QuillBot, Wordtune, Scholarcy, Resoomer, and TLDR This help make long content shorter. They use smart technology to pick out important information and create brief summaries. Elicit is good for summarizing web pages, SciSpace focuses on science stuff, QuillBot can rewrite and summarize, Wordtune helps with writing, Scholarcy is for academic papers, Resoomer works for various content, and TLDR This quickly summarizes articles and documents. These tools save time and make information easier to understand by getting to the main points.
