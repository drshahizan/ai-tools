# Zotero

Zotero is a powerful tool that can greatly facilitate the process of creating systematic literature review articles. Here's how you can use Zotero for this purpose:

1. **Collecting Sources**: Zotero can be used in conjunction with the Zotero Connector to gather relevant materials being researched, such as websites, academic sources, or technical briefs¬≤. You can upload multiple citations at one time from PubMed to Zotero for your systematic review¬π.

2. **Organizing Materials**: Zotero collections or folders are a useful tool for organizing materials pertaining to a single research project. It is advised to organize all materials into a folder that can later be organized into a literature review for a specific research assignment¬≤.

3. **Annotating Items**: Zotero has the ability to create notes for each reference as you collect and organize them. We will use this function to annotate for every source being tracked. To create a note, select an entry of your library and switch to the "notes" tab. These should contain useful information for your research¬≤.

4. **Creating a Literature Review**: Once you've created notes for a list of items in Zotero, you can export them to create your literature review¬≤.

5. **Collaboration**: Zotero also allows for easy collaboration, making it ideal for team projects. You can share your library with others and work together on the same project¬≤.

Remember, the key to a successful literature review is a systematic and organized approach, and Zotero provides the tools to do just that¬≤. Happy researching! üòä

## Zotero: Tagging
Adding tags to an item in Zotero is a straightforward process. Here are the steps:

1. Select the item in the center Zotero pane that you want to add a tag to¬π.
2. Click the Tags tab in the right-hand pane¬π.
3. Click the Add button¬π.
4. Type the tag name¬π.
5. Press Enter/Return¬π.

You can rename a tag by clicking on it and typing the new name¬π. Once you have added the tag, it will also appear in the tag selector in the bottom left¬π.

Remember, tags are a powerful mechanism for managing content in Zotero. They allow you to filter and sort your Zotero library in almost limitless ways to find specific content, and to see connections between items¬≤. You can also organize tags by assigning colors to your most important ones¬≤. Happy researching! üìö

## Zotero: Adding articles
Adding articles with PDF files to Zotero is quite simple. Here are the steps:

1. **Importing PDFs**: Drag your existing PDFs into your Zotero library or use the ‚ÄúStore Copy of File‚Äù or ‚ÄúLink to File‚Äù options from the add new item menu (green plus sign)‚Å¥. Zotero will automatically retrieve metadata for each PDF, create an appropriate parent item, and rename the associated file based on the metadata‚Å¥.

2. **Viewing a PDF in Your Browser**: If you are viewing a PDF file in your browser, the save button will show a PDF icon¬π. Clicking this button will import the PDF file alone into your library and then automatically attempt to retrieve information about it¬π. If Zotero isn't able to retrieve metadata, it will leave the PDF as a standalone attachment¬π. To add metadata, you'll need to create a parent item¬π.

3. **Adding Metadata to a Standalone PDF**: If you save a PDF directly and Zotero isn't able to retrieve metadata, you can add metadata by creating a parent item¬π. This can be done by saving a regular bibliographic item as described above and dragging the PDF on top of it or by right-clicking on the PDF, choosing Create Parent Item, and entering an identifier such as a DOI or ISBN¬π. If all else fails, you can click Manual Entry after selecting Create Parent Item and manually enter metadata for the item¬π.

Remember, Zotero is a powerful tool for managing your research. It allows you to collect, organize, and cite your research sources efficiently¬π‚Å¥.
