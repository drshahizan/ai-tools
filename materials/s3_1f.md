# How to Conduct a Systematic Literature Review?

## Writing the Conclusion

The conclusion of an SLR is an opportunity for the researchers to summarize the key findings of the review and to draw meaningful conclusions about the topic of interest. The conclusion should be based on the data and should be supported by the results of the studies included in the review.

### i. Summarizing the Key Findings
The main conclusions of the review should be outlined in the conclusion, along with any patterns and trends found in the data and any points of agreement or disagreement in the literature. The reader will receive a clear and succinct summary of the body of research on the subject from this.

Here is a table summarizing the key steps involved in summarizing the key findings of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in computer science:

| Step | Description | Computer Science Example |
|:------:|-------------|--------------------------|
| 1    | Identify the key findings from the studies | In a SLR investigating the use of machine learning algorithms in image recognition, the key findings might include: the most commonly used algorithms, the datasets they have been applied to, the accuracy rates achieved, and the limitations of the existing approaches. |
| 2    | Organize the findings into themes or categories | The findings from the studies in the SLR on machine learning algorithms for image recognition might be organized into themes such as: algorithms used for object detection, algorithms used for image classification, and algorithms used for object recognition. |
| 3    | Summarize the key findings for each theme | For each of the themes, the key findings could be summarized in a concise manner, for example: For object detection, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) were found to be the most commonly used algorithms. For image classification, the highest accuracy rates were achieved using deep learning algorithms such as ResNet and DenseNet. For object recognition, transfer learning was found to be an effective approach. |
| 4    | Provide a comprehensive overview of the key findings | A comprehensive overview of the key findings would summarize the key findings from each theme and present them in a manner that provides a clear picture of the state of the field. For example: In the SLR on machine learning algorithms for image recognition, the key findings indicate that CNNs and R-CNNs are the most commonly used algorithms for object detection, deep learning algorithms such as ResNet and DenseNet achieve the highest accuracy rates for image classification, and transfer learning is an effective approach for object recognition. |

By following these steps, researchers can effectively summarize the key findings of an SLR, providing valuable insights into the state of the field and the most promising directions for future research.

### ii. Drawing Conclusions
The conclusion should then proceed to make inferences regarding the subject of interest in light of the information and findings from the reviewed studies. This can entail summarizing the main conclusions, resolving any data limitations, and going over the conclusions’ consequences.

| Steps | Description | Computer Science Example |
|:-------:|-------------|--------------------------|
| 1. Synthesizing Key Findings | Summarize the results of the studies included in the review and identify common themes or patterns. | In a systematic literature review of computer vision techniques for object recognition, the researcher may synthesize the key findings by summarizing the accuracy rates and limitations of each technique studied. |
| 2. Addressing Limitations | Acknowledge and address any limitations in the data, including limitations of the studies included in the review and any biases present in the results. | For example, in the computer vision review mentioned above, the researcher may address limitations such as small sample sizes or a lack of diversity in the datasets used for testing. |
| 3. Discussing Implications | Discuss the implications of the findings, including the impact on current understanding of the topic and future directions for research. | For example, in the computer vision review, the researcher may discuss the implications of the findings for object recognition in real-world applications and suggest future directions for improving accuracy and robustness. |

This table provides a step-by-step guide for drawing conclusions in a systematic literature review and gives a concrete example from the field of computer science.

### iii. Making Recommendations
The conclusion may, if suitable, also contain suggestions for more study or application. For instance, if there is a gap in the literature, the conclusion can suggest that additional research be done to close it. Similar to this, the review's findings may recommend that particular therapies be used in practice if it appears that they are more successful than others.

Here's a tabular representation for the “Making Recommendations” step of a systematic literature review:

| Step | Description | Example from Computer Science |
|:------:|-------------|--------------------------|
| Making Recommendations | The conclusion should include recommendations for future research or practice based on the findings of the review. | If the systematic literature review on machine learning algorithms in computer vision finds that a particular algorithm consistently performs better than others, the conclusion may recommend that this algorithm be adopted in practice for solving computer vision problems. |

To sum up, the conclusion section of an SLR is a crucial step in the review process since it gives the researchers a chance to highlight the most relevant findings and formulate insightful judgments about the subject of interest. The researchers can contribute to expanding our understanding of the subject and make a significant contribution to the field by summarizing the important findings, coming to conclusions, and offering suggestions for further research or practice.

## How do I Deal with Missing Data in my SLR?

In an SLR, dealing with missing data depends on the extent and importance of the missing information. There are several approaches to handling missing data, including:

1. **Listwise deletion:** This involves excluding any studies with missing data from the analysis. This approach is suitable when the amount of missing data is small.
2. **Imputation:** This involves estimating missing values based on available data. There are several methods of imputation, including mean imputation, median imputation, and multiple imputation.
3. **Maximum likelihood estimation:** This involves estimating the missing values based on a statistical model that takes into account the observed data and the assumptions about the missing data.
4. **Sensitivity analysis:** This involves repeating the analysis with different assumptions about the missing data to assess the robustness of the results.

Ultimately, the choice of method for dealing with missing data will depend on the specifics of the SLR, the amount of missing data, and the importance of the missing information.

## Pros and Cons of Conducting Systematic Literature Review

**Pros of Systematic Literature Review:**

1. **Comprehensive and In-Depth Analysis:** SLR provides a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the existing literature on a specific topic, allowing for a thorough understanding of the current state of research in the field.
