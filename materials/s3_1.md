| 5    | Refine the Search                      | Add synonyms, eliminate irrelevant results, add constraints (such as date, language) |

By following these steps, you can effectively search for relevant literature in your field, which will serve as the foundation for your SLR.


### iv. Defining the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Defining the inclusion and exclusion standards for the studies must then be established. Choosing things like the study population, publication date, and study design type may be necessary for this. Only high-quality studies should be included in the review, and the inclusion criteria should be stringent enough to achieve this while still being open-ended enough to allow for a thorough assessment of the literature.

Summarizing the steps for defining the inclusion and exclusion criteria for a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                           | Example |
|------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Determine the Purpose of the Review   | To evaluate the current state-of-the-art in deep learning for image recognition |

| 4    | Establish Exclusion Criteria          | Conference papers, books, articles not related to image recognition |
| 5    | Evaluate the Relevance of Each Study   | Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, determine if the study should be included in the review |

By doing these actions, you can make sure that the studies you include in your SLR are pertinent to the review's goal and scope. This will aid in generating reliable and insightful results.

In summary, an SLR's preparation phase is essential to its success. Researchers can make sure that their SLR is well-defined, thorough, and relevant by following these crucial stages, and they can also make sure that they are able to make useful deductions about the existing state of knowledge in their area of interest.

## Searching for Studies

### i. Searching for research
The next phase in performing an SLR is searching for research, which entails using the search terms and databases established during the preparation stage to find pertinent studies. This is commonly done by searching electronic databases, but it is also possible to search other sources like conference proceedings and grey literature.

Electronic database searches are a useful tool for finding many studies on a particular subject. It's crucial to use numerous databases and the search terms determined during the preparation step when performing a database search. In order to focus their searches, researchers should be careful when utilising Boolean operators like **AND** and **OR**

Process of conducting an electronic database search as part of the Searching for Studies stage in an SLR

| Steps | Description                                         | Computer Science Example                                      |

| 1.    | Use multiple databases                             | Use multiple databases such as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library to search for relevant studies. |
| 2.    | Use search terms identified during the preparation stage | Use search terms such as “machine learning,” “computer vision,” and “deep learning” to locate relevant studies.    |
| 3.    | Refine searches using Boolean operators            | Use Boolean operators such as “AND” and “OR” to refine searches, for example: (“machine learning” AND “computer vision”) OR “deep learning.” |

This table provides an overview of the key steps involved in conducting an electronic database search as part of an SLR, using a computer science example. This process can help researchers to locate a large number of relevant studies on a given topic and is an important step in the overall SLR process.

### ii. Screening the Studies**

Finding the studies and screening them for eligibility are the following steps. This entails comparing each study to the inclusion and exclusion standards established during the planning phase. Studies that don't fit the requirements for inclusion are taken out of the review, while those that do are kept in for additional examination.

Screening the Studies

|     | Study Title                                  | Inclusion Criteria                  | Exclusion Criteria                              | Eligibility |

This table provides a concise overview of the key information for each study, including the study ID, author(s), year, title, research method, number of participants/samples, and results. By organizing the studies in this manner, it becomes easier to assess the quality and relevance of each study, compare the results of different studies,

In conclusion, searching for studies is an important step in conducting an SLR. By using electronic database searches, screening the studies for eligibility, and managing the studies in an organized manner, researchers can ensure that they have located all relevant studies on their topic of interest and that they are ready to move on to the next stage of the SLR process.

## Appraising the Quality of the Studies

An important part of doing an SLR is assessing the caliber of the research, which entails assessing the caliber of each study that was included in the review. This phase helps to reduce the risk of deriving the wrong conclusions from low-quality studies and helps to guarantee that the review's findings are supported by high-quality studies.

### i. Determining Quality Criteria
Choosing the quality standards to be applied is the first stage in evaluating the studies' level of quality. These guidelines should be based on acknowledged practices in the field and pertinent to the sort of study being conducted. For a randomized controlled trial, the appropriate sample size, the allocation concealment mechanism, and the blinding of participants and outcome assessors might all be considered as quality criteria.

Steps for determining quality criteria for a systematic literature review (SLR)

| 2    | Organize the findings into themes or categories | The findings from the studies in the SLR on machine learning algorithms for image recognition might be organized into themes such as: algorithms used for object detection, algorithms used for image classification, and algorithms used for object recognition. |
| 3    | Summarize the key findings for each theme | For each of the themes, the key findings could be summarized in a concise manner, for example: For object detection, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) were found to be the most commonly used algorithms. For image classification, the highest accuracy rates were achieved using deep learning algorithms such as ResNet and DenseNet. For object recognition, transfer learning was found to be an effective approach. |
| 4    | Provide a comprehensive overview of the key findings | A comprehensive overview of the key findings would summarize the key findings from each theme and present them in a manner that provides a clear picture of the state of the field. For example: In the SLR on machine learning algorithms for image recognition, the key findings indicate that CNNs and R-CNNs are the most commonly used algorithms for object detection, deep learning algorithms such as ResNet and DenseNet achieve the highest accuracy rates for image classification, and transfer learning is an effective approach for object recognition.

### ii. Drawing Conclusions
Making judgments on the subject of interest is the last step in synthesizing the research findings. This could entail highlighting the most important conclusions, pointing out areas of agreement and disagreement, and addressing any data constraints. The findings from the studies cited in the review should be used to support the conclusions, which should be supported by the data.

Discussing Implications | Discuss the implications of the findings, including the impact on current understanding of the topic and future directions for research. | For example, in the computer vision review, the researcher may discuss the implications of the findings for object recognition in real-world applications and suggest future directions for improving accuracy and robustness. |

This table provides a step-by-step guide for drawing conclusions in a systematic literature review and gives a concrete example from the field of computer science.

**iii. Making Recommendations**: The conclusion may, if suitable, also contain suggestions for more study or application. For instance, if there is a gap in the literature, the conclusion can suggest that additional research be done to close it. Similar to this, the review's findings may recommend that particular therapies be used in practice if it appears that they are more successful than others.

Here's a tabular representation for the “Making Recommendations” step of a systematic literature review:

| Step | Description | Example from Computer Science |
|------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Making Recommendations | The conclusion should include recommendations for future research or practice based on the findings of the review. | If the systematic literature review on machine learning algorithms in computer vision finds that a particular algorithm consistently performs better than others, the conclusion may recommend that this algorithm be adopted in practice for solving computer vision problems. |

To sum up, the conclusion section of an SLR is a crucial step in the review process since it gives the researchers a chance to highlight the most relevant findings and formulate insightful judgments about the subject of interest. The researchers can contribute to expanding our understanding of the subject and make a significant contribution to the field by summarizing the important findings, coming to conclusions, and offering suggestions for further research or practice.

## How do I Deal with Missing Data in my SLR?

In an SLR, dealing with missing data depends on the extent and importance of the missing information. There are several approaches to handling missing data, including:

1. **Listwise deletion:** This involves excluding any studies with missing data from the analysis. This approach is suitable when the amount of missing data is small.
2. **Imputation:** This involves estimating missing values based on available data. There are several methods of imputation, including mean imputation, median imputation, and multiple imputation.
3. **Maximum likelihood estimation:** This involves estimating the missing values based on a statistical model that takes into account the observed data and the assumptions about the missing data.
4. **Sensitivity analysis:** This involves repeating the analysis with different assumptions about the missing data to assess the robustness of the results.

Ultimately, the choice of method for dealing with missing data will depend on the specifics of the SLR, the amount of missing data, and the importance of the missing information.
